            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                 Rinaldi Landscaping Service was started in 1989 by Dr. Jay Rinaldi &#38; his son Peter Rinaldi in Brunswick, New Jersey.
                 Dr. Rinaldi, a noted arborist, created the business initially to care for damaged or sick trees, but gradually
                 this evolved into the full service landscaping company it is today! The Rinaldi's take pride in what they do and
                 it shows in their meticulous attention to detail and desire to give you the lawn you've always dreamed of!!
